# teamgeneratorhw10

## Description

The deliverable for this project is an in-line application that creates a team generator. We created this in Node.js and used classes to create the employee info (with tests running to ensure the classes were set up correctly) and used inquirer to gather the necessary fields to build the employee profiles. This application is useful for managers and PMs who need to quickly build out a team roster for a project.

## Usage

Begin by running `node app.js` in the terminal. This will begin a series of prompts that will allow you to add your employee's info that will be on your team. Once all the info is added, an HTML file will automatically be created in the "output" folder of the repo.

## Testing

You can test this app by running the command above, entering the employee info, and checking the HTML created to ensure the app created the employee profiles correctly. You can also run `npm run test` in the terminal to ensure the classes are built out correctly
